PLEASE NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER BEING ACTIVELY DEVELOPED.

I learned a lot building this framework but I don't see a compelling reason to continue refactoring it when superior well-documented widely-used alternatives such as Laravel and React already exist. If your business still uses the framework for some reason and you need assistance, feel free to ping me. Special thanks to all of the users, testers, and contributors. Keep building! @chishiki
